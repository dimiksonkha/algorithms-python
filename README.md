# Algorithms implementaion and testing using Python

## Introduction
The most common Algorithms from computer science have been curated and implemented using programming language. I have used Python as programming language.
I have also done unit testing on implementation of Algorithms.

## List of Data Algorithm(s)
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort 
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
 
## Installation 
I did not add any requirments.txt for managing dependencies as you do not need to have install many things. Just install the follwings in your machine: 
- Python 3
- Pytest

## Running tests
Open the terminal (<code>ctrl+alt+t</code>) then type the following command(s):<br>  
<code>python3 -m pytest</code>
